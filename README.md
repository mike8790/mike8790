- Hi, I’m @mike8790
- 
- 🔬 I am a former Neuroscience researcher with almost a decade of experience working in research (including my PhD). 
- 👀 I am looking for new oppurtunities outside of academia, in particular as a data-analyst/ data-scientist.
- 👨‍🎓 I’m currently expanding and strengthening my experience with common data-analytic/ data-science tools. Especially Python and SQL.
- 📌 As such I am using this repository for two reasons: 1. Give a glimpse of my extensive coding experience (largely in Matlab) 
- 📌 2. Store/ keep track of mini-projects as I learn more 
- 📫 You can contact me on [LinkdedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/michael-longley-data) or by [E-mail](mailto:michael.longley87@gmail.com)
